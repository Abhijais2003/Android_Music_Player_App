My Music Player App
This is a Java project for CSE310 that implements a music player app for Android devices. The app allows users to browse and play music files stored on their device, create playlists, and customize the playback options.

Installation
To install the app, follow these steps:

Clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine.
https://github.com/Abhijais2003/CSE310_JAVA_Project.git


Open the project in Android Studio by selecting "Open an existing Android Studio project" from the welcome screen and navigating to the directory where you cloned the project.

Build the app by clicking on the "Build" button in the toolbar or selecting "Build > Make Project" from the main menu.

Run the app on an Android emulator or physical device by clicking on the "Run" button in the toolbar or selecting "Run > Run app" from the main menu.

Usage
When you launch the app, you will be presented with the main screen, which shows a list of all the music files on your device. You can browse the list by scrolling up and down or using the search bar at the top to filter the results.

To play a song, simply tap on its name in the list. The app will start playing the song and display its title, artist, and album art on the playback screen. You can control the playback using the buttons at the bottom of the screen, including play/pause, skip forward/backward, and repeat/shuffle.

To create a playlist, go to the "Playlists" tab and tap on the "New Playlist" button. Give your playlist a name and then select the songs you want to add to it. You can also edit or delete existing playlists by long-pressing on their names in the list.

To customize the app settings, go to the "Settings" tab and adjust the options as desired. You can change the playback speed, equalizer settings, and other options to optimize the app for your listening preferences.
